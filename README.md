### Why is this using MongoDB and not a relational database?

Ease of use. I have yet to find a good library for ORM/DRM in Python, and Mongo is much easier to make one for.

Now, please do not make an issue saying something like "oh, just use [insert sql library]". These libraries are huge and have APIs that are awful to work with.
